# Home_Automation

Technology is never ending and new developments to make life simpler by automating things, is what is happening now. As a part of this broader objective. Since smart phones have become an inevitable part of todayâ€™s digital world and people carry it with them almost all the time, it would be more apt to use a mobile phone to control the appliances. Hence, in this project I used a simple android app to control the appliances.


The project is done using Arduino board and the command is sent via Bluetooth (the Transmitting and receiving pins serve this purpose) to Arduino which enables us to control the appliances with one click. A multi-channel relay module (here 4 channel) is employed so that more than one appliance can be controlled. A potentiometer is employed for changing the speed / brightness. The project utilises Arduino UNO for programming so that commands sent from Bluetooth are sensed and the appliances are switched ON/OFF or dimmed accordingly.
